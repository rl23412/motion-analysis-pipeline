# Implementation Summary: Custom SNI_2 and week4-TBI_3 Embedding Pipeline

## Overview

I have successfully created a custom behavioral embedding pipeline specifically designed to train on your `SNI_2.mat` and `week4-TBI_3.mat` files, then re-embed all other files in your dataset using this trained embedding space.

## What I've Created

### 1. Main MATLAB Pipeline
**File**: `custom_embedding_pipeline_SNI_TBI.m`

This is the core pipeline that:
- ✅ Loads only `SNI_2.mat` and `week4-TBI_3.mat` for training
- ✅ Creates flipped versions for left-right asymmetry analysis
- ✅ Performs PCA and wavelet decomposition on training data only
- ✅ Generates t-SNE embedding and watershed regions from training data
- ✅ Re-embeds all other 28 files onto the trained embedding space
- ✅ Creates comprehensive visualizations and analyses
- ✅ Includes batch correction and parameter optimization
- ✅ Saves all results in organized .mat files

### 2. Python Interface
**File**: `python_embedding_interface.py`

A comprehensive Python interface that:
- ✅ Validates your data directory and file formats
- ✅ Provides data loading and preprocessing utilities
- ✅ Creates overview visualizations and statistics
- ✅ Interfaces with MATLAB results for further analysis
- ✅ Exports metadata and summary reports
- ✅ Includes error checking and recommendations

### 3. Validation Script
**File**: `validation_script.m`

A comprehensive validation tool that:
- ✅ Checks MATLAB environment and required toolboxes
- ✅ Validates data file availability and formats
- ✅ Tests training data integrity
- ✅ Provides memory and performance estimates
- ✅ Creates basic data visualizations
- ✅ Gives specific recommendations before running the pipeline

### 4. Documentation
**File**: `README_SNI_TBI_Embedding.md`

Complete documentation including:
- ✅ Step-by-step usage instructions
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Performance optimization tips
- ✅ Results interpretation guide
- ✅ Customization options

## Key Features

- Maintains consistency across all analyses by using the same embedding space

### 🧠 **Advanced Analysis**
- Creates flipped versions for asymmetry detection
- Includes batch correction and parameter optimization
- Generates watershed regions for behavioral segmentation
- Creates comprehensive visualizations

### 🔍 **Validation & Testing**
- Pre-flight checks for data integrity

- Basic data visualizations

### 📊 **Rich Outputs**
- Behavioral density maps
- Group comparison plots  
- Individual mouse analyses
- Temporal comparisons (week1 vs week4)
- Statistical summaries

## Your Data Structure

The pipeline expects your data in this structure:
```
/work/rl349/dannce/mouse14/allData/
├── SNI_2.mat [TRAINING FILE]
├── week4-TBI_3.mat [TRAINING FILE]
├── DRG_1.mat through DRG_5.mat
├── IT_1.mat, IT_2.mat
├── SC_1.mat through SC_6.mat
├── SNI_1.mat, SNI_3.mat
├── week4-DRG_1.mat through week4-DRG_3.mat
├── week4-SC_1.mat through week4-SC_3.mat
├── week4-SNI_1.mat through week4-SNI_3.mat
└── week4-TBI_1.mat, week4-TBI_2.mat, week4-TBI_4.mat
```

**Training**: 2 files (SNI_2.mat, week4-TBI_3.mat)  
**Re-embedding**: 28 files (all others)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Validate Setup
```bash
# Option A: Python validation (recommended)
python python_embedding_interface.py

# Option B: MATLAB validation
matlab -r "validation_script; exit"
```

### Step 2: Run Pipeline
```matlab
% In MATLAB
custom_embedding_pipeline_SNI_TBI
```

### Step 3: Analyze Results
The pipeline creates multiple outputs:
- `complete_embedding_results_SNI_TBI.mat` - Main results
- Multiple visualization figures
- Summary statistics and metadata

## Generated Files

### MATLAB Outputs
- `vecsMus_SNI_TBI_training.mat` - PCA components from training
