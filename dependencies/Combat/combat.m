% This is a simplified placeholder for ComBat batch correction.
% For full ComBat functionality, please install the ComBat package
% from: https://github.com/Jfortin1/ComBatHarmonization
%
% Inputs:
%   X          - Data matrix (features x samples)
%   batch      - Batch vector (length = number of samples)
%   mod        - Design matrix for covariates (samples x covariates)
%   parametric - Use parametric ComBat (default: true)
%
% Outputs:
%   X_corrected - Batch-corrected data matrix

% Note: This is a very basic implementation. Real ComBat does:
% 1. Empirical Bayes estimation of batch effects
% 2. Handles both location and scale differences
% 3. Preserves biological variation while removing batch effects
% 4. Uses shrinkage estimators for small batches
